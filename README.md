# To-Do-List

To-Do-List is a website allow user to add and delete to-do-list to their respository. Need to connect to a mongodb database.

Create a database named:
todolistDB

or change this line of code to the name that you wish to have:
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/todolistDB(change this name)"

To-do-List allow users to create their own path besides about, work, home.. etc, user can specific the name after localhost:3000. (Ex. localhost:3000/my-to-do-List) to add more new unique routes for the user.
